Case study
Hansen Industrial Transmissions boosts application performance with Pure Storage and Proact
"Hansen Industrial Transmissions (HIT), the Belgian division of Sumitomo Drive Technologies, has been a trusted provider and leading manufacturer of quality power transmission solutions for almost 100 years. Its plant in Edegem, near Antwerp, has a global customer base. It is also the location of the global R&D department for industrial gearbox applications."
The challenge
"The IT infrastructure at Hansen Industrial Transmissions supports engineering, manufacturing and office staff. The existing storage platform was no longer able to provide the performance the company needed to realize its business goals."
The solution
"After evaluating various solutions, the IT team selected the Pure Storage FlashArray X20. Herta Van den Eynde, ICT Technology Specialist at Hansen Industrial Transmissions, explains: “We selected this platform, because it is an all flash system, providing excellent performance. Furthermore, the platform supports VMware and SPARC Solaris, as well as Veeam backup from storage snapshots. In addition, the platform is easy to manage and provides impressive deduplication and compression capabilities.”"
"Proact was selected as the partner to deliver and implement the Pure Storage system at HIT. “With their expertise and knowledge, Proact proved to be the right party to deploy the system,” says Raf Vervecken, ICT Technology Specialist at Hansen Industrial Transmissions. He points out that the business has benefitted greatly from the new system.“ All of the data was migrated on-line in just a matter of days, with no discernable impact on business operations."
"“The new Pure Storage platform, delivered and implemented by Proact, offers many advantages, such as significantly improved performance, with a high deduplication + compression ratio, and better management and monitoring interfaces.”"

The broad portfolio of industrial gearboxes stands for versatile applications where peak loads in rough applications are the rule. The wide range of bevel and spur gear units is designed for high radial and axial loads.
"With the acquisition of the Belgian company Hansen Industrial Transmissions NV in 2011, Sumitomo further expanded its competence as a supplier of reducers and massively supplemented its own portfolio."
"Today, the in-house competencies range from basic research, development and product design to construction and manufacturing and are complemented by product-specific after-sales services. As a result, customer-specific projects are designed promptly and application requirements are fully met by reliable industrial gear units and flexible gear options."
